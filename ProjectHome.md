[Robocar World Championship](https://code.google.com/p/robocar-emulator/wiki/RobocarWorldChampionship) is intended to offer a common research platform for developing urban traffic control algorithms and for investigating the relationship between smart cities and robot cars with particular attention to spread of robot cars of the near future. At the heart of this initiative is the Robocar City Emulator. It will enable researchers to test and validate their theories and models.

The following figure shows a high-level "Tetris" plan of the project

  * **Map**: Competitions are played on an OSM ([OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about)) map.
  * **City**: Each competition is assigned to a city.
  * **ASA**: (Automated Sensor Annotations) This subsystem will automatically collect traffic data using video cameras. The collected data will be used in the [smartcity](https://code.google.com/p/robocar-emulator/source/browse/justine/rcemu/src/smartcity.hpp) program.
